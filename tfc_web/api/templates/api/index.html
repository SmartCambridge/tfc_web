<h1>Smart Cambridge Data API and data downloads</h1>

<p>SmartCambridge's work is focused on acquiring, processing and using
data in real time. As part of that processing we archive the data
we collect and make it available for reuse.</p>

<p>Archived data can be accessed in two ways:</p>

<ul>
    <li>By <a href="{% url 'download_api' %}">Download</a> which provide the data in
    bulk as 'comma separated variable' (CSV) files which can
    be imported into a range of tools for analysis.</li>
    <li>Via the <a href="{% url 'program_api' %}">Program API</a> which is ideal for
    use by programs and apps.</li>
</ul>

<p>Available data:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="{% url 'aq_home' %}">Air Quality</a> data from a selection
of sensors deployed around Cambridge between June 2016 and February
2017.</li>

<li><a href="{% url 'parking_home' %}">Car Parking</a> data showing
the occupancy of Cambridge City Centre and Park and Ride car parks from
2017 onward.</li>

<li><a href="{% url 'traffic_home' %}">Traffic Speed</a> data for
roads within Cambridge based on bus position reports from
October 2017 onward.</li>

<li>(Via the Program API only) bus transport data from the <a
href="https://data.gov.uk/dataset/ff93ffc1-6656-47d8-9155-85ea0b8f2251
/national-public-transport-access-nodes-naptan">National Public
Transport Access Nodes (NaPTAN)</a> and <a
href="http://www.travelinedata.org.uk/traveline-open-data/traveline-
national-dataset/">Traveline National Dataset (TNDS)</a> resources.</li>

</ul>

<p>The data is available to anyone, but you have to register and agree
to the platform's <a href="{% url 'smartcambridge-tcs' %}">Terms and
Conditions</a> before you can access it.</p>
