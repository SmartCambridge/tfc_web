<h1>Smart Cambridge APIs</h1>

<p>This API provides programmatic access to information maintained by
the Smart Cambridge project.</p>

<p>Currently available:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="{% url 'aq_home' %}">Air Quality</a> data from a selection
of sensors deployed around Cambridge between June 2016 and February
2017.</li>

<li><a href="{% url 'parking_home' %}"> Car Parking</a> data showing
the occupancy of Cambridge City Centre and Park and Ride car parks from
2017 onward.</li>

<li><a href="{% url 'traffic_home' %}">Traffic Speed</a> data for a
number of roads within Cambridge based on bus position reports from
October 2017 onward.</li>

<li>API access to bus transport data from the <a
href="https://data.gov.uk/dataset/ff93ffc1-6656-47d8-9155-85ea0b8f2251
/national-public-transport-access-nodes-naptan">National Public
Transport Access Nodes (NaPTAN)</a> and <a
href="http://www.travelinedata.org.uk/traveline-open-data/traveline-
national-dataset/">Traveline National Dataset (TNDS)</a> resources.</li>

</ul>

<h2>API Endpoints</h2>

<p>There is a seperate 
<a href="{% url 'api-docs:docs-index'%}">reference
page documenting the API endpoints</a>.</p>

<p>The API operates over HTTP using REST-like conventions with
parameters encoded in URL paths and query parameters. It can be accessed
by any tool capable of making HTTP requests and interpreting the
results. The reference page promotes the use of the <a
href="http://www.coreapi.org/">CoreAPI</a> toolset but the API is in no
way restricted to CoreAPI-aware tools.</p>

<h2>Authentication</h2>

<p>All API calls must be authenticated by someone who has agreed to the
platform's 
<a href="{% url 'smartcambridge-tcs' %}">Terms and
Conditions</a>. You make authenticated calls either:</p>

<ul>

<li>by <a href="{% url 'login-and-agree' %}">signing in</a> (and
agreeing the terms and conditions if you haven't already)</li>

<li>by including an API token with the call. Beware that API calls made
from browsers, for example from JavaScript, will always succeed for as
long as you are logged in to this website <em>even if you are not
successfully supplying a token</em>.</li>

</ul>

<p>To call the API using the 'Interact' links on the
<a href="{% url 'api-docs:docs-index' %}">reference page</a>
you can also authenticate using the
'Authentication' menu at the bottom-left of that page providing you
have already agreed to the terms and conditions.</p>

<h2>Tokens</h2>

<p>You can <a href="{% url 'create_token' %}">create</a> and
subsequently
<a href="{% url 'manage_tokens' %}">manage</a> as many API tokens as you
want.</p>

<p>To use a token for authentication, include it in an
<tt>Authorization</tt> HTTP header in your requests, proceeded by the
word <tt>Token</tt> and a single space:</p>

<pre>
Authorization: Token 9944b09199c62bcf9418ad846dd0e4bbdfc6ee4b
</pre>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre>
curl -H 'Authorization: Token 9944b09199c62bcf9418ad846dd0e4bbdfc6ee4b' https://smartambridge.org/api/v1/aq/ 
</pre>

<p>Tokens used by JavaScript applications are of necessity exposed. To
minimise the impact of this you can associate any token with a list of
'referer' patterns. Access using that token will then be rejected if the
'Referer' header provided by a browser don't match any of the patterns.
While this is easily subverted in server-side scripts and by using
custom proxies it does make it slightly harder to misuse tokens
that are exposed in this way.</p>

<p>You can setup referer restrictions on tokens from the 
<a href="{% url 'manage_tokens' %}">token management page</a>.</p>

<h2>Rate limiting</h2>

<p>Access to the API is rate-limited to 1200 requests per minute and
12000 requests per hour per token for token-based access, or per user
otherwise.</p>

<h2>Results format</h2>

<p>Results are normally returned in <a
href="https://www.json.org/">JSON</a> with <tt>Content-Type:
application/json</tt>. However if a response is explicitly requested in
HTML by including an <tt>Accept: text/html</tt> header in the request
(as happens if the API is accessed directly from a browser) then results
are returned in human-friendly HTML.</p>

<p>Successful responses have HTTP status codes of <tt>200 OK</tt>. Other
status codes (at least <tt>400 Bad Request</tt>, <tt>401 Authorization
Required</tt>, and <tt>404 Not Found</tt>) indicate an error. Most
errors include an <tt>application/json</tt> body containing further
information. Some errors, in particular any that generate bogus URLs,
generate generic HTML <tt>404 Not found</tt> pages with 
<tt>Content-Type: text/html</tt>.

<p>Individual output formats are not documented, but should be 
self-explanatory. Some API calls that return lists of data items will return
<tt>200 OK</tt> responses with empty lists, rather than <tt>404 Not
found</tt>, if called with a valid request for which there happens to be
no data available (e.g because of the chosen date range).</p>
